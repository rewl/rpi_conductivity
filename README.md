Measuring the conductivity with the RPi2 via Atlas Scientific Conductivity EZO board
I try to create a small GUI-Application running on the Raspberry Pi 2 using Qt5. 
This application should communicate with the Conductivity EZO board from Atlas Scientific.
The main reason for starting this project is to learn the handling of git :-).
